# Supabase Configuration Complete! ✅

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully configured your Growing Together app to work with your Supabase instance. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. **Database Type Definitions Updated** ✅
Fixed `src/lib/database.types.ts` to match your actual Supabase schema:

#### Added Missing Tables:
- `plots` - Allotment plot management
- `comments` - Comments on posts and events
- `reactions` - Reactions to posts and comments
- `inspections` - Plot inspection records
- `rules` - Community rules
- `rule_acknowledgements` - User rule acceptance tracking
- `documents` - Document management

#### Fixed Existing Tables:
- **posts**: Changed `content` → `text`, added `is_announcement` field
- **join_codes**: Changed `current_uses` → `uses_count`, removed `is_active` field
- **diary_entries**: Added `plot_id`, `plant_id`, and `tags` fields
- **photos**: Added `updated_at` field

### 2. **Storage Bucket References Fixed** ✅
- Fixed `useInspections.ts` - Changed from non-existent `media` bucket to `photos` bucket
- All storage operations now use lowercase bucket names (`photos` and `documents`)

### 3. **Join Code Logic Updated** ✅
Fixed authentication and admin code to match schema changes:
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Removed `is_active` check, added proper validation using `expires_at` and `uses_count`
- `src/hooks/useAdmin.ts` - Updated join code creation and toggle logic
- `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Fixed display of uses count

## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED: Create Environment File

Since `.env` files are protected, you need to manually create your environment configuration:

### **Create `.env` file in project root:**

```bash
cd /Users/Lee/GrowingTogether
```

Then create a file named `.env` with this content:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yphxxvjpgmpozbgfrkva.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InlwaHh4dmpwZ21wb3piZ2Zya3ZhIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkyMTc2MTQsImV4cCI6MjA3NDc5MzYxNH0.vLq6C9K_5c-A0khlidI2SuyES7BqzUBIKhStn3RHHAw
```

**Quick command to create it:**
```bash
cat > .env << 'EOF'
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yphxxvjpgmpozbgfrkva.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InlwaHh4dmpwZ21wb3piZ2Zya3ZhIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkyMTc2MTQsImV4cCI6MjA3NDc5MzYxNH0.vLq6C9K_5c-A0khlidI2SuyES7BqzUBIKhStn3RHHAw
EOF
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Storage Buckets Case Sensitivity
Supabase storage bucket names are **case-sensitive**. Your buckets should be:
- `photos` (lowercase)
- `documents` (lowercase)

If you created them as "Photos" or "Documents" (capitalized), you'll need to either:
1. **Rename them in Supabase** to lowercase, OR
2. **Update the code** to use capitalized names

To check your bucket names:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Verify the exact casing
3. If they're capitalized, either rename them or let me know and I'll update the code

### Join Code Activation/Deactivation
Since your schema doesn't have an `is_active` field, the toggle functionality now works by:
- **Active**: `expires_at` is `null` or in the future
- **Inactive**: `expires_at` is set to current date (expired)

### Next Steps

1. ✅ **Create the `.env` file** (see above)
2. ✅ **Verify storage bucket names** match lowercase (`photos`, `documents`)
3. ✅ **Test the app** by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. ✅ **Check authentication** - Sign up/sign in should work
5. ✅ **Test photo uploads** - Gallery and inspections should upload to Supabase Storage
