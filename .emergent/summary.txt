The AI engineer's work trajectory can be divided into two distinct phases. Initially, the AI engineer focused on refining an existing React web app with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. This involved fixing React 19 compatibility issues by downgrading to React 18, correcting  import aliases to relative paths, and resolving authentication persistence problems. After extensive testing, the backend was confirmed 100% functional, and the frontend was deemed largely operational, addressing the buttons not working complaint. The engineer then began implementing UI/UX enhancements like an admin announcement banner, bigger buttons, and a calendar view for events, as per a detailed PDF specification.

However, the user then provided a critical update: the entire previous build was off-spec and required a complete rebuild. The new architecture shifted from React web app + FastAPI/MongoDB to Expo Router + React Native + TypeScript + Supabase + SQLite + Zustand + TanStack Query. The AI engineer accepted this pivot, downloaded new starter assets, and commenced a 16-step repair plan. Significant progress has been made on this new build, with steps 1 through 12 successfully completed, including the design system, navigation, Supabase authentication, offline caching, home screen, diary, plant library with AI, events management, community features, and tasks screen. The engineer is currently starting Step 13, focusing on the Gallery Screen.

<product_requirements>
The original goal was to develop a Growing Together Allotment Community App from a basic React+FastAPI+MongoDB template into a full-featured, offline-first application, following a detailed PDF specification. This included foundational APIs, authentication (Admin/Member/Guest), notification system, enhanced AI, advanced gallery, mobile optimization, real-time collaboration, advanced offline capabilities, analytics, and an enterprise admin dashboard.

However, the user later clarified that the existing React web app was fundamentally off-spec. The *revised* and *current* product requirement mandates a rebuild using Expo Router + React Native + TypeScript, integrating Supabase (for authentication and database), SQLite (for offline-first capabilities), Zustand (for state management), and TanStack Query (for data fetching/caching). The application must implement a comprehensive 16-step repair plan covering a design system, navigation skeleton, Supabase authentication with join codes, offline caching, a detailed home screen (announcements, weather, tasks, events, posts), diary with templates/filters/photo uploads, a Plant Library with UK plants data and Ask AI modal, Events with list/calendar views and RSVP, Community features (posts, comments, reactions), and Tasks (personal/site, photo proof).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack (Initial):** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database), Tailwind CSS.
- **Full-stack (Current/Rebuild):** Expo Router, React Native, TypeScript (frontend); Supabase (Auth, DB); SQLite (offline storage).
- **State Management:** Zustand, TanStack Query.
- **AI Integration:** Emergent LLM key,  library.
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with join codes.
- **UI/UX:** Design system with custom components.
- **Offline-first:** SQLite, mutation queue, background sync.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application architecture has transitioned from a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack to a new Expo Router/React Native/TypeScript stack.

**New Directory Structure (Post-Rebuild Initiation):**


**Key Files and Changes (New Rebuild):**
- : Configured Expo app details, name, and branding assets.
- : Updated with Expo, React Native, Supabase, SQLite, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod,  and other dependencies.
- : Configured Expo Router's root layout, defining bottom tab navigation, initializing TanStack Query client, and database setup.
- : Created placeholder screens (, , , , , , ) and the  screen for user authentication and onboarding.
- : A new design system including  (colors, fonts, sizes), , and various UI components like , , , , etc., ensuring a consistent garden-themed aesthetic and accessibility.
- : Configures the Supabase client for authentication and database interactions.
- : Initializes the SQLite local database for offline capabilities.
- : Contains logic for synchronizing local SQLite data with Supabase.
- : Sets up the TanStack Query client for efficient data fetching, caching, and state management.
- : Implements Zustand for global authentication state management.
- : Provides a template for Supabase API URL and anonymous key.
- : Custom hooks (, , , , , ) created to encapsulate data fetching and mutation logic using TanStack Query, interacting with Supabase and local SQLite.
- : Various modal components (, , , , ) for user input and interactions across different features.
- : The  library was installed via  and  was updated. The  endpoint was updated to use this library for LLM interactions. This change happened in the old backend, but the new build does not use this backend.

The new architecture focuses heavily on mobile-first development with robust offline capabilities and a streamlined cloud backend (Supabase) for scalability.

<pending_tasks>
- Step 13: Gallery screen - Albums, bulk upload, image management (currently started).
- Step 14: Notifications - Local reminders and announcements.
- Step 15: Admin & Settings - Member management, join codes, export.
- Step 16: QA & Performance - Final testing and optimization.

<current_work>
The current work involves a complete rebuild of the Growing Together Allotment Community App following a new 16-step repair plan after the previous React web app was deemed off-spec. The new tech stack is Expo Router + React Native + TypeScript + Supabase + SQLite + Zustand + TanStack Query.

So far, steps 1 through 12 of the repair plan have been completed:
-   **Design System:** A comprehensive design system () with  and core components like , , , , , etc., has been established for a consistent garden-themed UI.
-   **Navigation Skeleton:** The basic bottom tab navigation structure () is set up with routes for Home, Diary, Events, Community, Gallery, Tasks, and More.
-   **Auth & Onboarding:** Supabase integration (, , ) is in place for authentication using join codes. An  file was created for Supabase credentials.
-   **Offline Cache Foundation:** SQLite () and offline sync logic () are set up, along with TanStack Query () for data management.
-   **Home Screen:** () implemented with all specified features including an announcement banner, weather widget, weekly tasks, upcoming events, and latest community posts.
-   **Diary Screen:** () implemented with templates, filters, and photo upload capabilities, supported by  hook and .
-   **Plant Library & AI:** () developed with a UK plants database, search functionality, and an Ask AI modal (, ) for plant care advice.
-   **Events Screen:** () implemented with both list and calendar views, RSVP functionality, and a  for event creation. A fix was applied to  to use simple text inputs for date/time selection instead of a problematic DateTimePicker.
-   **Community Screen:** () allows for posts, comments, reactions, and pinning, using  and .
-   **Tasks Screen:** () implemented to manage personal and site tasks, including photo proof uploads, task templates, due date tracking, statistics, filtering, and full CRUD operations, supported by  and .

The most recent work was completing Step 12 (Tasks Screen) and specifically fixing the Create Event and Create Task buttons to ensure their functionality. The engineer is now initiating Step 13, by creating the  hook.
